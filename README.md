**Here's a step-by-step guide to get you up and running:**

1. **Connect to Wi-Fi:** Make sure youâ€™re connected to the Accenture Wi-Fi or use your mobile data if you prefer.
1. Launch Chrome or Edge browser. Open two tabs.
1. In the first tab, navigate to Outlook.com. Login with your temporary GitHub account. This is where you will receive the Device Code.
1. In the second tab, navigate to GitHub.com and login using your temporary GitHub account. When asked for a Device Code, enter the code you received in your email (Outlook tab).
1. Are you logged in? Great! If not, raise your hand and we'll have someone help you out. 
1. In the same GitHub.com tab, copy and paste this URL.

    ```https://github.com/alvinvinalon/GitHubCopilot-Hackathon```

1. Click the Fork button on the top right corner of the page. This will create a copy of the repo in your temporary GitHub account.
1. After creating the fork, click the Code button, select the Codespaces tab, and click the New Codespace button. This will launch GitHub Codespaces.
