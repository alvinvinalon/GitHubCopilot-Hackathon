# Setting up your Codespace

It's time to fork the repo in GitHub. 
This will create a copy of the repo in your temporary GitHub account, which you can then work on with GitHub Codespaces.

## Pre-requisites:
- The temporary GitHub account you received when you registered for the event.

## Steps:

1. Launch Chrome or Edge browser. Open two tabs.
1. In the first tab, navigate to Outlook.com. Login with your temporary GitHub account. This is where you will receive the Device Code.
1. In the second tab, navigate to to GitHub.com and login using your temporary GitHub account. When asked for a Device Code, enter the code you received in your email (Outlook tab).
1. Are you logged in? Great! If not, raise your had and we'll have someone help you out. 
1. In the same GitHub.com tab, copy and paste this URL.

    ```https://github.com/alvinvinalon/GitHubCopilot-Hackathon```

1. Click the Fork button on the top right corner of the page. This will create a copy of the repo in your temporary GitHub account.
1. After creating the fork, click the Code button, select the Codespaces tab, and click the New Codespace button. This will launch GitHub Codespaces.
1. Wait for the Codespace to load. This may take a few minutes.
