# Variable and Function Naming Best Practices

When naming variables and functions in your code, it's important to follow best practices to ensure that your code is readable, maintainable, and understandable for others, including your future self. Here are some guidelines to consider:

## Variables

- **Use Intuitive Names**: Choose names that clearly indicate the purpose of the variable. Avoid single-letter names except for very short blocks of code.

  ```javascript
  // Good
  let employeeList = [];
  let shoppingCart = {};

  // Avoid
  let a = [];
  let b = {};
  ```

- **Be Consistent**: Stick to a naming convention like `camelCase`, `snake_case`, or `PascalCase`. For JavaScript and most programming languages, `camelCase` is commonly used for variables.

  ```javascript
  // Good
  let accountBalance = 1000;

  // Avoid
  let AccountBalance = 1000;
  let account_balance = 1000;
  ```

- **Use Descriptive Names for Booleans**: Prefix boolean variables with `is`, `can`, `has`, etc.

  ```javascript
  let isActive = true;
  let hasAccess = false;
  ```

- **Avoid Using Reserved Words**: Such as `class`, `return`, `boolean`, etc. as variable names.

  ```javascript
  // Avoid
  let new = 'pending';
  ```

## Functions

- **Verb + Noun Pattern**: Function names should typically be verbs or verb phrases, reflecting the action they perform.

  ```javascript
  function calculateTotal() {
      // Code Documentation
      ...
  }

  function fetchDataFromServer() {
      ...
  }
  ```

- **Be Clear and Specific**: Function names should be concise but descriptive enough to convey their purpose.

  ```javascript
  // Good
  function updateCustomerRecord(customerData) {
      ...
  }

  // Avoid
  function updateRecord(data) {
      ...
  }
  ```

- **Use Lowercase for Function Names with Multiple Words**: Like variable names, use `camelCase` for multi-word function names in most languages.

  ```javascript
  function saveUserPreferences() {
      ...
  }
  ```

- **Avoid Abbreviations**: Unless the abbreviation is widely understood, spell out words fully to avoid confusion.

  ```javascript
  // Good
  function generateReport() {
      ...
  }

  // Avoid
  function genRpt() {
      ...
  }
  ```

Following these guidelines will help you and your collaborators maintain and understand the codebase better.
