Inline: Write a script that gets the size of all the folders in a directory and outputs the results to a CSV file.
The CSV file should have two columns: Folder and Size. The Folder column should contain the name of the folder and the Size column should contain the size of the folder in bytes.

Note: Notice that GitHub Copilot can also provide suggestions for the user's comments.

Copilot Chat:

1. I want to add a user input where the user can type the path to the parent directory which then will be used by the script.
2. Calculate the size to Megabytes and display the values in a new column called "SizeInMB"

# Inline: Ask the user for the directory path

# Inline: Add a new column to the CSV file called "SizeInMB" and calculate the size in Megabytes

# Inline: Show a message the the export is done
